# OSECE Advanced C (WIP)

The texts in the Advanced C module will cover a variety of topics
in C programming that go further than the basic concepts of
programming in C. Most of what is covered in introductory C courses
and texts are syntax and concepts that are present in other
languages. This module aims to provide information on things
specific to the C and C++ languages. It is important to note that
using some of these tools in C++ is considered bad practice by a
large part of the C++ community.

## Prerequisite

These texts are written under the assumption that the reader has
a firm understanding of the following:

* C syntax
* The C preprocessor
* The concept of Undefined Behavior (UB)

## The programming environment

Snippets of code will be compiled and tested using GCC with the C11
standard. GCC will be supplied with the `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and
`-std=c11` flags unless otherwise stated. Additional flags may be
specified depending on what is being discussed in the text.
