# OSECE (WIP)
Open Source Electrical and Computer Engineering (OSECE)

## About
The OSECE project is centered around the idea that any person should have access to educational resources for any field or subject free of charge. OSECE specifically focuses on Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) education. The goal of OSECE is to provide in-depth material that covers a variety of ECE topics including (but not limited to) electric circuit analysis and computer programming. This material will be presented in the form of both text and video.

## Disclaimer
OSECE is in its earliest stage, and we are still figuring out how exactly we want things to be done.

## Contributing to OSECE
We are not currently accepting contributions at this time.
